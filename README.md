# Day_Planner
I started by inserting the time and date through javascript. 
Then I created a div for each of the day's work hours, with a text input field and submission button. 
I created variables for these elements and an onclick event to store what has been entered within the local storage and the console.log. 
Created an if statement that keeps the data on the page through a refresh via local storage.
